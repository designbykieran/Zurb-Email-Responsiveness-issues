# Zurb-Email-Responsiveness-issues
Have been creating a HTML email 'campaign' for a local company, never touched on this before and initial attempted to use HTML with bootstrap and my own external stylesheet - which obviously didn't work. Have been getting along just fine with Zurb's Foundation for Emails, until I come to 'inline' the CSS styling using the online 'Responsive Email Inliner' by Zurb, now my email is not responsive at all. Some areas of content resize but not all, where am I going wrong?
